          <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p> Bedbugs are small, oval, brownish insects that live on the blood of animals or humans. Adult bedbugs have flat bodies about the size of an apple seed. After feeding, however, their bodies swell and are a reddish color. Bedbugs do not fly, but they can move quickly over floors, walls, and ceilings. Female bedbugs may lay hundreds of eggs, each of which is about the size of a speck of dust, over a lifetime. Immature bedbugs, called nymphs, shed their skins five times before reaching maturity and require a meal of blood before each shedding. Under favorable conditions the bugs can develop fully in as little as a month and produce three or more generations per year. Although they are a nuisance, they are not thought to transmit diseases. Simple Pest Solutions offers a new innovated non-toxic chemical treatment for bed bugs. With this type of method bed bugs are frozen and eliminated. Please contact office for more details.

          <h3>BEDBUG BITES</h3>
          <img src="resources/css/img/Bed-bug-guide-bites.jpg"  alt="" class="img-fluid">
          
            <p><span>What do bedbug bites look like?</span><br>
Some people will not experience a reaction to a bedbug bite at all. Those that do experience symptoms of a bite are likely to experience one or more of the following:
<ul>
<li>a bite with a red, swollen area and a dark red center</li>
<li>bites in a line or grouped together in a small area</li>
<li>blisters or hives at the bite site</li>
</ul>
Bites can happen anywhere on the body. Most commonly they occur on areas of skin that are exposed while sleeping, such as the face, arms, legs, and hands.</p>

            <h3>FINDING THE PEST</h3>
          <img src="resources/css/img/bed-bugs-on-bed-sheet.jpg"  alt="" class="img-fluid">
          <p><span>Where are the hotspots?</span><br>
Some people find bedbugs under the box spring, carpet, headboard, seams of the mattress, in molding, clothes, sneakers, anywhere that has fabric and a host to feed on.
<ul>
<li>a proper inspection of the perimeter is required</li>
<li>the threshold of the infestation is determined</li>
<li>a liquid or a cryonite service is applied</li>
</ul>
It is always recommended that a pest control professional is aquired. Chemical treatment needs to be mixed and measured to render a proper solution when handling bedbugs.</p>

          <p><span>How do we treat for bedbugs?</span><br>

<li>we make sure the treatment was successful with a follow up</li>
</ul>

          <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p> After mating, females lay white, oval eggs (1/16" long) into cracks and crevices. An individual bed bug can lay 200 to 250 eggs in her lifetime.
             The eggs hatch in 6 to 10 days and the newly emerged nymphs seek a blood meal. Immature nymphs molt five times (they shed their outer exoskeleton) before reaching adulthood. There may be three or more generations per year. All ages are found in a reproducing population. Under normal circumstances adult bed bugs will live for about 2 to 4 months. Bed bugs need to feed at least once before each molt, although they could feed as often as once a day.
             Young nymphs can survive without a blood meal for days up to several months. Older nymphs and adults can survive longer without a blood meal up to a year under favorable conditions. Bed bugs are also found in schools, retail facilities, office buildings, libraries and other public areas.
