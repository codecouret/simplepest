<h5>FROM COLLEGE STUDENT</h5><br>
</div>
<p>In my college years I was struggling financially paying for my classes and helping my mother at the same time. I wanted to finish what I started but it was difficult paying my bills and studying. I was getting jobs that were not interesting or profitable. One day my friend recommended that I apply for a pest control position with a company. He knew I loved working hands on and helping people. I got the job and understood how helpful I could be in the pest control industry.</p>


<p>I made it my mission to help customers in the best way possible with there pest situation. I fell in love with the concept of helping, connecting and seeing how happy customers were after I solved there pest issue. I was known as the pest problem solver. I knew that it was always possible to solve pest issues for clients. It brought me great satisfaction doing my job.</p><br>

<p>After six months of pest control customer service I knew this was my passion. I graduated college and decided one day I will open up my own company in order to serve customers at a professional level. I now have twenty years of experience.  I decided to move on and create my own company called Simple Pest Solutions. I was ready to provide service for poeple with quility work at a practical price. </p><br>
