          <h5>Why are Roaches Harmful to Humens?</h5>
          <li> Cockroaches can carry and transmit many pathogens. Studies have linked roaches to the spread of salmonellosis, cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, gastroenteritis, giardia, E. coli, listeriosis, as well as leprosy and plague. They play a supplementary role in the spread of diseases, not a primary one.
          </li><br>
          <li>They will crawl on toilet rims, inside garbage cans, and in the gap beside ovens, and carry harmful bacteria to your food prep surfaces, dish cabinets, silverware drawers, and food storage areas. When they do, they will spread harmful bacteria that can result in a wide range of stomach ailments. 
          </li><br>
          <h5>How to Proctect Yourself</h5>
          <li>To remain safe and healthy from different types of cockroaches, pest control and management is key. However, with approximately 4,000 living species of cockroaches in the world, and about 70 species found in the United States.

<h5>PROPERTY DAMAGE & HOUSE FIRES</h5><br>
<p>Squirrels and rats and skunks, oh my! Rodents in the attic, trash cans and under the house can gnaw on your nerves and your property. Many rodents’ front teeth grow continually, so they gnaw incessantly on surfaces to wear their teeth down.</p><br>

<h5>PROPERTY DAMAGE & HOUSE FIRES</h5><br>

<p>Once inside a home or business, rodents go to work on the electrical wiring, PVC plumbing pipes, heating and air conditioning ducts and anything else they can sink their teeth into. Remember, you don’t have to live in the country to be bothered by wildlife – we deal with wildlife problems.</p><br>
</div>


<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
<h5>RAT BITES</h5><br>

<p>Not only do rodents chew, they bite! If they feel threatened, rats, chipmunks and other rodents can inflict painful bites and pass infections, strep bacteria and even rabies.</p><br><br>

<h5>PESTS & VECTORS</h5><br>

<p>Vectors such as fleas, mites and ticks are part of the rodent habitat. These feasting insects transmit diseases by feeding on infected rodents and then biting humans. In turn, rodents transmit diseases carried by the insects by biting humans or other animals.</p><br>
</div>


<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
<h5>CONTAMINATION</h5><br>

<p>Airborne Transmission: Humans and other mammals can become contaminated with a variety of diseases and viruses through exposure to infected rodents’ droppings, urine and saliva. Rodent droppings should be handled with care, especially after they’ve dried, when they can break apart and release airborne particles that can enter nasal passages and cause infection.</p><br>

<p>Salmonella: Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to mammals when they eat foods contaminated with an infected rodent’s excrement.</p><br>

<p>Hantavirus: People can become infected with the Hantavirus by inhaling contaminated dust, touching one’s mouth or nose after handling contaminated materials or by living in a rodent-infested setting.</p>

          <h5>Why Mosqutieos Harmful to Humens?</h5>
          <li> Female mosquitos bite humans to consume blood. In doing so, they cause irritation and swelling but can also transmit some extremely harmful and sometimes fatal diseases. They can also cause harmful allergic reactions in some people. Malaria, dengue fever, and yellow fever are only a few mosquito-borne conditions.
          </li><br>
          <li>“Mosquitoes are perhaps the most dangerous animals in the world,” Omar Akbari, PhD, an assistant professor of entomology at the Center for Disease Vector Research at the University of California Riverside, told Healthline. “They are the primary vectors for major human diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, and dengue fever, which together infect hundreds of millions of humans worldwide and kill millions each year.” 
          </li><br>
          <h5>How to Proctect Yourself</h5>
          <li>Simple Pest Sloution professionals should be able to offer additional methods or alternatives to preventing mosquito bites this season. Education and proper protection are the best ways enjoy the outdoors while avoiding potentially harmful mosquito bites.

          <ul>
          <h5>Ants and why are they dangerous?</h5>
          <li> The vast majority of ants are intrinsically not harmful to humans. For instance, you could pick one up and all it will do is scamper around on your hand without biting or stinging. However, this does not apply to all species. Red ants are some of the most feared in terms of being harmful. These ants may be small, but they have a very painful bite.
          </li><br>
          <h5>Damages</h5>
          <li>carpenter ants are wood-destroying pests. These ants are by far the most dangerous type of ants that invade our homes and businesses. They can also target outbuildings and any other wooden belongings stored on our properties or sometimes even inside our homes.
          </li><br>
          <h5>Types of ants</h5>
          <li>Types of Ants: Eight Common Invaders. Acrobat ants (Crematogaster) Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) Asian needle ant (Pachycondyla chinensis) Carpenter ants (Camponotus) Crazy ant (Paratrechina longicornis) Dark rover ants (Brachymyrmex patagonicus) European fire ant (Myrmica rubra) Field ant (Formica)
          </li><br>
          <h5>How to Proctect Yourself</h5>
          <li>It’s probably not surprising to hear that ants most frequently infest kitchens. Reducing moisture and standing water around your home can go a long way to help prevent ants. Store food in sealed pest-proof containers. Store food in sealed pest-proof scontainers, and keep ripe fruit in the refrigerator. Inspect the outside of your home for easy access points. Contact a licensed pest professional right away.

                <h4>House flies</h4>
                <p>House flies are strongly suspected of transmitting at least 65 diseases to humans, including typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, poliomyelitis, yaws, anthrax, tularemia, leprosy and tuberculosis. Flies regurgitate and excrete wherever they come to rest and thereby mechanically transmit disease organisms. The eggs hatch into larvae, also known as maggots. Scheduling a home inspection may help you get rid of house flies.</p>

          <h4>Drain Flies</h4>
          <p> The drain flies which are commonly found in bathrooms, Clogmia albipunctata, are not known to carry any human diseases, but have been known to be an opportunistic agent of myiasis. The subfamily of Phlebotominae does feed on blood with the ability to transmit (tropical) diseases, and Sycorax silacea can transmit microfilaria. Inhalation of insect fragments may cause respiratory asthma.</p>

          <img src="resources/css/img/flesh-fly.jpg" class="center">
          <h4>Flesh Flies</h4>
          <p>They differ from most flies in that they are ovoviviparous, opportunistically depositing hatched or hatching maggots instead of eggs on carrion, dung, decaying material, or open wounds of mammals, hence their common name.  The adults mostly feed on fluids from animal bodies, nectar, sweet foods, fluids from animal waste and other organic substances.</p>

          <h4>Fruit Flies</h4>
          <p>If you have been seeing small flies or gnats in your kitchen, they're probably fruit flies. Fruit flies can be a problem year round, but are especially common during late summer/fall because they are attracted to ripened or fermenting fruits and vegetables. Fruit flies are also attracted to rotting bananas, potatoes, onions and other unrefrigerated produce purchased at the grocery store.</p>

          <h4>Horse Flies</h4>
          <p>Adult horse-flies feed on nectar and plant exudates; the males have weak mouthparts and only the females bite animals to obtain enough protein from blood to produce eggs. The mouthparts of females are formed into a stout stabbing organ with two pairs of sharp cutting blades, and a spongelike part used to lap up the blood that flows from the wound. The larvae are predaceous and grow in semiaquatic habitats.</p>

        <img src="resources/css/img/blowfly.jpg" class="center">
          <h4>Horse Flies</h4>
          <p>Adults may be vectors of pathogens of diseases such as dysentery. Blow flies have frequently been associated with disease transmission in humans and animals, as well as myiasis. During the process of decay, microorganisms may be released through the body. The larvae begin eating and breaking down the corpse, simultaneously ingesting these organisms which is the first step of one transmission route.</p>

I finally took a gamble and searched online for the best of the best and decided to give simple pest a try, it took 2 visits and a profound exterminating service but it did the trick, I have not seen a roach or water bug in my kitchen since 2017!!! GOD BLESS YOU SIMPLE PEST SOLUTIONS!!!
